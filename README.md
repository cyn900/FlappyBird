## Flappy Bird Neural Network 

In this workshop, we’ll explore the fundamentals of iOS game development and introductory neural networks through a hands-on Flappy Bird project. No prior experience is required.

Participants will build a working iOS game using Swift and SpriteKit, learning how games are structured on iOS, how physics and animations work, and how user interactions are handled. The workshop will then demonstrate how a simple neural network can be integrated into the game to automatically control the bird. You’ll see how game state data—such as the bird’s position and distance to obstacles—can be used to make decisions and how basic learning techniques can improve gameplay over time.
